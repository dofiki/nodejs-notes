    <h1>Node.js Request and Response Objects</h1>

    <h2>Request (req) Object:</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>req</code> object represents the incoming HTTP request made by the client to the server.
        It contains information about the client's request and allows the server to access various aspects of the request.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>URL (<code>req.url</code>):</strong>
            <p>Represents the URL path requested by the client. Allows the server to determine which resource or route is being accessed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Method (<code>req.method</code>):</strong>
            <p>Indicates the HTTP method used by the client (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Enables the server to handle different types of requests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Headers (<code>req.headers</code>):</strong>
            <p>Provides an object containing all the HTTP headers sent by the client. Headers include information such as content type, user agent, and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Body (<code>req.body</code>):</strong>
            <p>Contains the data sent by the client in the request body (for POST and PUT requests). Parsing and handling the request body are common tasks when dealing with form submissions or API requests.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Response (res) Object:</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>res</code> object represents the server's response to the client's request.
        It allows the server to send back information, including headers and the response body.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Set Header (<code>res.setHeader(name, value)</code>):</strong>
            <p>Used to set HTTP headers in the response. Headers define metadata about the response, such as content type, encoding, or caching instructions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Write to Response Body (<code>res.write(data)</code>):</strong>
            <p>Adds data to the response body. The response body contains the content that will be sent to the client.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>End Response (<code>res.end()</code>):</strong>
            <p>Finalizes the response and sends it to the client. Once <code>res.end()</code> is called, the response is complete, and no further modifications can be made.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
